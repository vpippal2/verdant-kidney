in this case we are using a simple json store to store data, it will be enough for this excersise, but feel free to replace it with any tool you feel used to work with.

## Tasks

###Finish inventory implementation by creating a web interface for this api to:

1. Create a new inventory Item
2. Archive an inventory Item
3. Add stock to the inventory item
4. Remove stock from the inventory

Along the way you may encounter code that may need to be fixed, please comment on each of them on git commit or directly on code whatever way fit your style of development.
